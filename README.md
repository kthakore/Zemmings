Zemmings
========

Zemmings want your brains or flesh or stuff


    21:59 < awwaiid> how is that different than normal lemmings?
    22:00 <@kthakore_> same idea except if zemmings gets to 
    22:00 <@kthakore_> the end
    22:00 <@kthakore_> your town gets infected and you have more 'zemmings' next 
                       level
    22:00 <@kthakore_> and less townspeople
    22:00 <@kthakore_> townspeople < 0 means game ends
    22:02 <@kthakore_> garu is working on menu
    22:02 <@kthakore_> he will be at pyle game room in a ble
    22:02 <@kthakore_> bit*
    22:03 <@kthakore_> so basically you want to kill off the zemmings
    22:04 <@kthakore_> oooooor garu thinks have it other way
    22:04 <@kthakore_> there will be towns all over the map
    22:05 <@kthakore_> and you move the zombies around and have them take over
                       towns
    22:05 <@kthakore_> all the humans need to have to have did
    22:05 <@kthakore_> died*
    22:05 <@kthakore_> to win
    22:00 <@kthakore_> townspeople < 0 means game ends
    22:02 <@kthakore_> garu is working on menu
    22:02 <@kthakore_> he will be at pyle game room in a ble
    22:02 <@kthakore_> bit*
